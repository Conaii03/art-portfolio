Hi, my name is Cecilia Márquez and I'm a freelance artist. I work on illustrations and animations of any kind; from anime to western cartoons, I can adapt to any drawing style. As a hobbie I'm making slice-of-life comic strips, those of which you can see below. I'm currently still working on my career at the University Anáhuac Mayab, so I'm not looking for any full-time jobs.
